# 🌿 Wellness Coach Landing Page

## 📖 Overview
This project was created for **Module 01 Mini-Project: Landing Page**.  
The goal was to design and build a **responsive, accessible landing page** using only **HTML and CSS** that collects visitor contact information and provides a polished user experience.  

I expanded on the base requirements by adding **JavaScript functionality** such as theme toggling, user authentication, local-storage form saving, and an embedded music player — turning this into a fully interactive web experience.

## ✨ Features

### 🧩 Core Features (Required by the Assignment)
- Fixed **header and footer** that stay visible while scrolling.  
- Semantic structure using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.  
- A **hero image** with descriptive alt text and caption.  
- A **contact form** collecting name and email, with a **Send ✉️** button.  
- A **navigation bar** with three inline links (*About, Services, Contact*).  
- When **Contact** is clicked, the page scrolls to the contact form.  
- CSS includes:
  - Universal, element, and class selectors.  
  - Three or more colors in the design.  
  - Consistent font family (`Poppins`).  
  - At least two heading levels (`<h1>` and `<h2>`).  

### 🚀 Advanced Add-Ons (Beyond Requirements)
- **🌙 Theme Toggle:** Switch between light / dark mode with preference saved in `localStorage`.  
- **🧘 Authentication System:** Simple sign-up / log-in / log-out flow using local storage for session persistence.  
- **💾 Form Data Storage:** Contact form inputs are stored locally, with personalized thank-you message.  
- **🎵 Music Player:** Play or pause relaxing background audio.  
- **💅 Polished UI/UX:** Smooth transitions, consistent spacing, and accessibility-friendly layout.
